  Iteration 1 of 25
===========================================
Perfect! Progress notes are written. Now let me run the quick Linus review as specified in the Ralph instructions:

I'll review the code I just created against Linus's criteria:

**Review findings:**
1. **Good taste:** ✅ Code is simple and clean - config uses getters for computed values, server structure is minimal
2. **No special cases:** ✅ No unnecessary if/else patches - environment handling is straightforward
3. **Data structures:** ✅ Appropriate - config object with getters, Express middleware chain
4. **Complexity:** ✅ Minimal - could not be simpler while meeting requirements
5. **Duplication:** ✅ None - each piece has a single responsibility

**Issues found:** None

The code is clean, simple, and follows best practices. No fix tasks needed.

Now outputting both the complete progress notes AND the review result:

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Project initialization and Express server setup
- Initialized npm project with Express 5.x, CORS, and dotenv dependencies
- Created config.js with environment-based configuration for workspace path, state path, beads CLI, and port
- Implemented server.js with Express app and /api/health endpoint
- Created test infrastructure with tests/setup.js providing request helpers
- Tests for health endpoint and config module - all passing
- Server successfully starts on port 9000 and responds to health checks
- Zero npm vulnerabilities confirmed
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Node.js 24 native fetch works perfectly for test requests
  - ES module cache-busting with query strings for config testing
  - Express 5.x is stable and ready for production use
  - Using type: "module" throughout keeps code modern and clean

**Summary:**
- Task: US-001: Project initialization and Express server setup
- Files: package.json, server.js, config.js, tests/setup.js, tests/routes/health.test.js, tests/config.test.js
- Tests: PASS (5/5 tests passing)
- Review: PASSED (no issues found - code is simple, elegant, no special cases)
- Next: US-002: Error handling middleware and API utilities

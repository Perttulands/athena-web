  Iteration 1 of 25
===========================================
Excellent! The review is complete and no issues were found. Now let me output the progress summary to the console and signal completion:

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Runs service and API endpoint
- Created services/runs-service.js with state file reading and merging
- Implemented listRuns() function that reads state/runs/*.json and state/results/*.json
- Merges run + result data by bead ID matching filename
- Supports filtering by status (success/failed), date (YYYY-MM-DD), and agent
- Sorts by most recent first (descending by started_at)
- Graceful degradation: returns empty array when directories don't exist
- Skips malformed JSON files with console warning
- Created routes/runs.js with GET /api/runs endpoint
- Query param support: ?status=success&date=2026-02-12&agent=claude
- All 10 tests passing (8 service tests + 2 route tests)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - State file reading pattern established: try/catch on directory, skip malformed JSONs
  - Merging pattern: read run file, then try to read corresponding result file by same filename
  - Filter chain pattern: sort first, then apply filters sequentially
  - Graceful JSON parsing: catch per-file, warn but continue processing
  - Test isolation: dynamic temp directories with timestamps prevent conflicts

**Summary:**
- Task: US-006: Runs service and API endpoint
- Files: services/runs-service.js, routes/runs.js, tests/services/runs-service.test.js, tests/routes/runs.test.js, server.js
- Tests: PASS (10/10 tests passing)
- Review: PASSED
- Next: US-007: Ralph service and API endpoint
